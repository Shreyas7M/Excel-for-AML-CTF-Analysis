## 📘 Excel Data Analytics in AML Financial Intelligence Analysis

This repository contains a side project I created to explore how Microsoft Excel can be effectively used for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CFT) financial intelligence analysis. While most AML/CFT teams rely on specialised analytical tools, I wanted to demonstrate how Excel—an affordable and accessible tool—can still play a powerful role in investigations when used correctly.

The goal of this project was to build a practical, beginner-friendly resource that walks through essential Excel features, analytical functions, and investigative techniques commonly used in financial crime analysis.
